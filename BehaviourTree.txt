Behaviour tree:

Node States:
-None
-Runing
-Ok
-Fail

Node Types:
-Action Node: leaf node that executes an action (move to positio, attack, etc), None, Runing, Ok, Fail return states.
-Conditional Node: ask questions, Ok and Fail return states only.
-Logic Nodes: can have children of type conditionals.
-Decorator Node: used to modifie a child node (i.e. negate the return value of a conditional node).
-Sequence Node: run children nodes in sequence until one returns false.
-Selector Node: run childern until finds one that returns true.

Nodes With Children: Logic Node, Decorator Node, Sequence Node, Selector Node.

Node Leaf: Action Node, Condition Node.
